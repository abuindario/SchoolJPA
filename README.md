# SchoolJPA
Practice exercise that includes online database connection using JPA.
This small project allows me to show my knowledge about the basics of Java, Java OOP and JPA-Hibernate.

To use this program, the user must clone this repository locally, and then execute it with his default IDE (running this program in Eclipse IDE is recommended). 
The program is designed to be used on the IDE Console. 

This program simulates a school, where the user can take control over the Entities: Students, Subjects and Teachers. It is possible to create, read, update and delete every 
instance of an object.
Sample Students, Subjects and Teachers are provided by default, the program is connected to an online database (freesqldatabase.com). The aim of this project is to show that 
it works without mistakes and, for so, username and password of the database connection are visible to everyone. Please, don't do any harm.
